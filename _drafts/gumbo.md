I like to make a roux like described in [Alton Brown's Gumbo recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/shrimp-gumbo-recipe-1946875). The 4 ounces of oil and flour works great to make a rich roux base for my size pot.&nbsp;

* 4oz flour
* vegetable oil
* 1 large onion (about 2 cups chopped)
* 1 large bell pepper (about 2 cups chopped)
* 2 celary ribs (about 1 cup chopped
* 1lb chicken thighs (I prefer bone in, but boneless is easier)
* 1lb smoked sausage
* 2 quarts of water (I just top off the pot once all the ingredients are in)
* &nbsp;
