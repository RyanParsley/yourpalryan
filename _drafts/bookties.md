9lbs Pork Shoulder (Piknic)

5lbs Flour

10lbs Potatoes (Peeled, quartered)

Peek and quarter Russet potatoes. Boil potatoes until tender (20min?). Drain and set aside.

Preheat oven to 425. Salt and pepper the shoulder. Roast for 20min. Reduce heat to 325 and cook for about 4hrs until the port reads 185. Remove from oven and rest 30min.

While roast is going, roughly mash potatoes. Pour in about a third of the flour roll into a ball a little smaller than a baseball.

Clean potato pot. Fill half way with water and bring to boil.

Drop a few in the boiling water until they float (15-20min). Batch about 1 layer to not croud.

Take each batch out back to the cookie sheets for now. Let cool.

Cut in half to check for doneness. Should not still look floury.

Pour out half or more of drippings.

Cut into bite size bits and toss in pan drippings in the roast pan.
